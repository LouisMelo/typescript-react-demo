This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## About this project
This is a demo project I created when I'm learning Redux from Dan Abramov's tutorial. Instead of using ES6 syntax, I'm using TypeScript to rewrite his Todo app in order to get familiar with TypeScript.

A lot of pieces of code can be improved. However, its aim is to help me understand Redux from scratch and get around with TypeScript.

Please give me any kind of your advices. That would definitely help me to enhance my ability. Thanks a lot!
